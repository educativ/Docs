This Method is used for sharing text between apps.

If choose is defined, an android dialog will appear with the **choose** value as info text.
Otherwise the dialog will appear if the user did not specify an app which should be always opened for this type of data.

The **subject** parameter seems to be obsolete these times and is just kept for backwards compatibility.
