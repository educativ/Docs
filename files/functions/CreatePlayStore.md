Notes: If your email address is listed in the 'licence testing' section of the developer console settings page, then using this sample will result in a test subscription with an order id of '1234' which recurs daily (even if configured for monthly) and you will not be charged.
Subscriptions can be cancelled in the Google Play App found on your device (they will stay active for the remains of the period that has been purchased).
