You can use SetOnKey for receiving and handling all key events fired in the application.

You may want to use it with **DisableKeys** - i.e. for defining a custom _ENTER_ command for automatic control focussing.

You can find the complete list of keys and their codes on the [Android Developer Page](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#summary).
