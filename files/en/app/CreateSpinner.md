Create Spinners using the CreateSpinner method of the app object.
You can allow the Spinner to auto-size by leaving out the dimensions or you can specify a **width** and/or **height** as decimal fractions of the screen's width and height.

Use the **SetOnChange** method of your spinner to set the name of a function you want to be called when the user selects an item.

You can get the current selection of the Spinner button at any time using the **GetText** method and replace the option list at any time by using the **SetList** method.

Use the **SelectItem** method to select a particular item in code.
